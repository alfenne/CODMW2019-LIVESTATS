# Call of Duty Modern Warfare Real-Time Stats

I have a Raspberry Pi with a 3.5" Adafruit TFT Display next to my TV running this application. While you are playing Call of Duty modern warfare you can view various personal stats change in near real-time. 

### Usage

1) Change the global variable on line 9 in flaskServer.py to your gamertag

My gamertag is 'import winner', sorry if this is confusing given the context

2) Display this application in any way you'd like
